# LowoUI-AS

It created for making user interfaces with rich animation performence for the games using scaleform middleware, but you know I really don't like setting the MovieClip to component, it's inconvenient for the development iteration.

- **MovieClip** : Creates 'in', 'stay' and 'out' movie state animations are supported with timeline. But also, you can embed them to the MC by using actionscript danamically, if you do this, the timeline animations will be overrided and not work. So you have multiple choices to design it.
- **Asset Manager**
    - swf
    - texture
    - audio
    - font
- **Data Organization**
    - config
    - setting
- **Smaple**
    - entry : the container of all swfs and customize all interfaces for external call.
